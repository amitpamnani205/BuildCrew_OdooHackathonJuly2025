# 💡 Skill Swap Platform

## ✅ Problem Statement

Develop a Skill Swap Platform — a mini application that enables users to list their skills and request others in return

### Features:
- Basic info: Name, location (optional), profile photo (optional)
- List of skills offered
- List of skills wanted
- Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
- User can make their profile public or private.
- Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., “Photoshop” or “Excel”)
- Request & Accept Swaps:
    ○ Accept or reject swap offers <br>
    ○ Show current and pending swap requests
- Ratings or feedback after a swap
- The user is also able to delete the swap request if it is not accepted.

### Admin Role:
● Reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions. <br>
● Ban users who violate platform policies. <br>
● Monitor pending, accepted, or cancelled swaps. <br>
● Send platform-wide messages (e.g., feature updates, downtime alerts). <br>
● Download reports of user activity, feedback logs, and swap stats. <br>
